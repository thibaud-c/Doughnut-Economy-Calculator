          | Mentioned first in Kate Raworth‚Äôs paper ÀùA safe and just space for humanityÀù, doughnut economic model is a concept of sustainable development whose main goals are to bring social foundations to every person, but not to burden the planet in the process and exploit the nature to the point of no return. The economy throughout the world for now is based on growth, but this growth can‚Äôt go on forever since we have limited resources on the planet. It‚Äôs time to bring a change and make the world safer and more equal between the countries.

          | How do we  
          span.text-indigo-600 calculate 
          span the doughnut model?
        p.mt-2.text-sm.text-gray-500(class='md:text-base')
          | The first step of implementing a doughnut economy is to establish the current situation in a specific country/city. We do this by getting information about every indicator of social foundations (e.g. food, education, health, income and work‚Ä¶), and also the ecological ceiling indicators (e.g. climate change, biodiversity loss, ozone layer depletion‚Ä¶). This allows us to visualize the doughnut ‚Äì to see where the country stands and what are the factors that need most immediate action.

          | The greedy nature of people in charge all around the world is directly influencing the natural resources that are already very limited. In order to continue living like we do now, we would need 5 planets as natural resources. Since we only have one, we have to change the approach and implement a sustainable, doughnut economy in the place of never ending and impossible growth.
